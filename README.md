**AI-Powered Projects
Important: The code in this repository was mostly generated by AI (using WindSurf and other AI tools). I did not create the original implementations.

**What I Did:
Tested the AI-generated code & Made changes and fixes

Customized and improved parts of it

Set up and configured the projects

**Added documentation

**About These Projects:
These are examples of what AI can create with guidance. They show how AI can help with coding, but still need human review and testing.

**Disclosure
Important !
These projects serve as:

Examples of AI-assisted development capabilities

Learning resources for understanding AI-generated code

Testing grounds for AI development workflows

Demonstrations with educational value

**Acknowledgments
Windsurf AI for generating the core implementations

Various AI coding assistants that contributed to these projects

The open-source community for inspiration and learning resources

**Note:
These are learning projects showing AI-assisted development, not my original work
